# Tech @ NC State Angular Tutorial / Example Repo




## Getting Started


### Installing npm if you are on OSX or Linux
 
try to run `npm`

If the command fails install it using your package manager

### For OSX

`brew update`
`brew install node`

or

### Debian and Ubuntu Based Linux Distributions

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash`
`chmod +x install.sh`
`./install.sh`

Restart your cli

`nvm install node`


### Installing npm if you aren't on OSX or Linux

[Installation Instructions](https://www.guru99.com/download-install-node-js.html)

Install Angular CLI

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Note: this will install Angular globally, you can remove the -g flag if you want to install locally only.


### Install An IDE

I highly reccommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.

However, you can use any IDE you want. We highly prefer IDEs that support linters.
