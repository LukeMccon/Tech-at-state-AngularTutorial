# Tech @ NC State Angular Tutorial / Example Repo




## Getting Started

Install npm if you aren't on OSX or Linux

[Installation Instructions](https://www.guru99.com/download-install-node-js.html)

Install Angular CLI

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Note: this will install Angular globally, you can remove the -g flag if you want to install locally only.


## Install An IDE

I highly reccommend installing [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.

However, you can use any IDE you want. We highly prefer IDEs that support linters.
